"""an example of using animate() and clock scheduling to move actoters around. 
there are 2 actors in this example each with a different movement strategy.

the block
--------
the block moves in a loop around the screen

the bloack moves in a loop around the screen
we schedule the move_block funcation to be called every 2 seconds using 
 clock.schedule_interval.
 the next position of the block is given by calling next() on a "cycle"
 object, returned by itertols.cycle(). this will cycle through the block
 we use animate() to move the block.

 the ship
 ------------

 the ship moves in a random dance in the middle of the screen. the ship flips back and forth between a rotation phase and movement phase

 * next_ship_target(): pick a new target location for the ship at random, and animate roatting the ship to aim at it.
 when the ratation animation is complete, we will calle move_ship()
 * move_ship(): move the ship to its target. when the move animation is complete we will call the next_ship_target().
